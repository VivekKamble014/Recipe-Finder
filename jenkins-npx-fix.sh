echo "🔧 Recipe Finder - Jenkins NPX Fix"
echo "=================================="

echo "✅ Fixed Jenkinsfile to use npx for local binaries!"
echo ""
echo "🎯 The issue was:"
echo "   ❌ 'eslint: not found' - local binaries not in PATH"
echo "   ✅ Fixed by using 'npx eslint .' instead of 'npm run lint'"
echo "   ✅ Fixed by using 'npx vite build' instead of 'npm run build'"
echo ""
echo "📝 Next steps:"
echo "1. Go to Jenkins: http://localhost:8080"
echo "2. Open your job: recipe-finder-deployment"
echo "3. Click 'Build Now'"
echo "4. Monitor the build progress"
echo ""
echo "🚀 The pipeline will now:"
echo "   ✅ Install Node.js using nvm"
echo "   ✅ Install project dependencies"
echo "   ✅ Run ESLint using npx (finds local eslint)"
echo "   ✅ Build React app using npx (finds local vite)"
echo "   ✅ Deploy using npm serve on port 3000"
echo ""
echo "🔍 After successful build:"
echo "   - Application: http://localhost:3000"
echo "   - Logs: /tmp/recipe-finder.log"
echo ""
echo "🎉 This should now work without 'eslint: not found' errors!"
echo ""
echo "💡 Key fix: npx automatically finds and runs local binaries"
echo "   from node_modules/.bin/ directory."
